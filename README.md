Welcome to Ben's Comparison tool.
I have found that many many times I need to compare 2 Lists and there is always a catch or trick the causes it to take 
a lot longer. Such as duplicate values.
I wanted to create something so simple even an idiot like Ben (that's me) can use but works in most cases. 
<br>
The design goal was to make it take less than in most cases it will take less than 10 minutes to figure out how
it works and once you know that, it will take less than 5 minutes to run it next time.
<br>
I also wanted to keep it pure Java in case anyone wanted to use it their projects there are no dependencies.
<br>
<br>

<b>GETTING STARTED</b><br>
1. Goto the "test" folder.
2. The "MainManualRunner" is the simplest example of how to run the program. You can run that...
3. Goto the "runners" sub folder... This will have more complex examples including how to load from a CSV file.
4. The "runners" have parameters at the top, just fill those in and run.
5. You can create your own and put them in the module

TODO:

Convert the input values to an object. (DO NOT REQUIRE THAT TO RUN, JUST INTERNALLY)
Handle nulls for input values (names and sets)

Compare:
* Exclude List
* Remove the "Exact" duplicates before you normalize.
* Remove blanks
* Might want to change variable names to indicate what they do... put "normalize" as part of trim and ignore case

* Do we want to a custom text in the config to display?
