This document is designed to help explain the results so anyone can use this and understand what they are looking at.



"Total Items" - This is EVERYTHING passed for comparison. It can include duplicates and blanks.

"Duplicates Removed" - This is total number of duplicate values removed from the total items after you do things like
make values all Upper Case and remove extra spaces.

"Blanks Removed" - These are the values removed when you pull out anything is blank.
Blank is defined as anything that is ALL whitespace. (Think empty cells, spaces or returns)

"In BOTH" - These are the values that match! So they are in both List 1 AND List 2

"Total Items in (LIST 1) that are NOT in (LIST 2):" - For ALL values that are in one list but not in the other list!


THE FORMULA IS:
Total Items =  Duplicates Removed + Blanks Removed + In BOTH + Total Items IN but not in other
